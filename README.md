# ⚡ Energy Consumption Trend Analysis using Power BI

This project focuses on analyzing energy consumption trends using a real-world Excel dataset. It aims to identify patterns in electricity, gas, and water usage, highlight cost inefficiencies, and provide interactive dashboards for easy exploration.

## 📌 Project Objectives

- Analyze monthly and utility-wise energy consumption patterns
- Identify high vs normal cost behavior using dynamic thresholds
- Create a professional and interactive Power BI report
- Improve user experience with collapsible navigation and KPI cards

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies Used

- **Power BI Desktop**
- **Power Query Editor**
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)**
- **Excel (data source)**
- **Power BI Bookmarks & Navigation Pane**
- **Custom Theme JSON (Light & Impactful)**

## 🗂️ Project Structure

- `PowerBI_Report.pbix` – Main Power BI report file
- `README.md` – This documentation file

## 📊 Dashboards Overview

1. **Dashboard 1: Monthly Consumption Overview**
   - Line and bar charts showing consumption trends over time

2. **Dashboard 2: Utility-Wise Cost Comparison**
   - Stacked visuals comparing electricity, gas, and water costs

3. **Dashboard 3: High vs Normal Cost Matrix**
   - Matrix visual showing cost classification per utility and time

4. **Dashboard 4: KPI Summary & High Cost Detection**
   - KPI cards and bar chart showing count of high-cost entries

## 🚀 Key Features

- ✅ Dynamic DAX-based classification (`Cost per Unit`, `High Cost Flag`)
- ✅ KPI indicators for total usage, cost, and alerts
- ✅ Interactive collapsible navigation menu using bookmarks
- ✅ Clean layout with a custom, light-impact Power BI theme

## 🧠 Learning Outcomes

- Learned to clean, reshape, and model energy data effectively
- Applied custom DAX formulas for advanced analytics
- Designed user-friendly reports with professional visual hierarchy
- Implemented smooth page-to-page navigation with a toggle menu

## 📌 Problem Statement

Lack of visual insight into utility consumption data leads to missed opportunities in identifying cost inefficiencies. This project addresses the need for clear, interactive dashboards that help monitor energy usage and detect anomalies.

## ✅ Conclusion

This Power BI project demonstrates how energy consumption data can be transformed into actionable insights. By leveraging interactive visuals, threshold-based flags, and an intuitive UI, the report serves as a powerful tool for analysis and decision-making.
